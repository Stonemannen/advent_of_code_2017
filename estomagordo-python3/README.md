Hiya!

To run a particular solution to a challenge, just run the files using Python 3 from out of the `advent_of_code_2017` directory.

For instance: `python estomagordo-python3\4a.py` should run the solution to the first challenge from December 4th, using Windows slash conventions. This assumes the base directory has got a file called `input_4.txt` in the `advent_of_code_2017` directory.

To run the golfed solution if present (see [golf/README.md](golf/README.md) for more information), just do `python estomagordo-python3\golf\4a.py` instead.

Run `golf.py` for some quick statistics for the golf project. Note: this will execute every golfed solution, along with its regular counterpart.
